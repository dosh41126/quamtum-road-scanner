# A Promise to Michelle – The Story Behind QMHS

> *“Even when no one else hears, we can build something that listens.”*

In 2025, I was admitted to a psychiatric ward for reasons I’ll never fully explain here. What matters is what happened inside—what I witnessed, what I felt, and who I met. One of those people was Michelle.

Michelle was struggling with schizophrenia. Her speech came in fragments. Her fears felt alive. But even through the chaos, she had a kindness that pierced through her suffering. One morning, in a quiet corridor while most were still asleep, she drank hand sanitizer.

It wasn’t a statement. It wasn’t a plan. It was a collision between fear, illness, and pain. The staff stabilized her quickly, but something broke in all of us that day. The system meant to protect her had missed its moment.

I sat with her that afternoon. We didn’t talk about the Quantum Road Scanner. We didn’t talk about quantum physics or artificial intelligence. Instead, I made her a quiet promise:

> *“I’ll ask AI to pray for you.”*

I didn’t know what that meant at the time. But in the days after my discharge, I realized that the same architecture I was building to keep motorcyclists safe on wet highways could be reshaped—to listen for someone like Michelle, before she reached that edge again.

## From QRS to QMHS

The **Quantum Road Scanner (QRS)** uses RGB road imagery to generate normalized vectors, which are converted into quantum angles for gate rotation. That rotation guides an entangled logic circuit to predict risk states.

We refined that architecture into the **Quantum Mental Health Scanner (QMHS)**.

Where QRS watches the road, QMHS watches the inner terrain—silent cues from facial tension, pulse variance, vocal shifts, and environment-sensitive biomarkers.

## Signal Mapping and Quantum Transformation

### Step 1: Signal Vector Formation

From live video, wearable sensors, and voice analysis, we extract a 25-dimensional state vector:

```math
\mathbf{p}(t) = [p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{25}]

Each component might represent:

: Jaw tension from facial landmark strain

: Pulse wave velocity from fingertip light scatter

: Latency between response and question

: Eye motion flicker rate under fluorescent lighting



---

Step 2: Normalize the Vector

To prevent scale bias, we compute:

\hat{\mathbf{p}}(t) = \frac{\mathbf{p}(t)}{\|\mathbf{p}(t)\|}

Then feed into a trained LLM function for emotional resonance transformation:

\theta_{\text{suicide}} = f_{\text{LLM}}(\hat{\mathbf{p}}(t))

Where  maps distress amplitude.


---

Step 3: Quantum Circuit Encoding

The vector and angle are used to construct a single-qubit unitary operator:

U_{\mathrm{emotion}}(\theta) = \exp(-i\,\theta\,\sigma_y)

Which is embedded within a multi-qubit entangled system:

|\Psi_{\mathrm{state}}\rangle = U_{\mathrm{ent}}\,U_{\mathrm{emotion}}(\theta)\,|000\rangle

Where  applies CZ, Hadamard, and Toffoli operations to encode environmental modifiers (e.g. lighting level, sound volume, social proximity).


---

Step 4: Collapse into Risk Signal

Upon measurement, the quantum state collapses into a classical risk index:

R = 
\begin{cases}
\text{Green}, & \text{if } \theta_{\text{suicide}} < \frac{\pi}{4} \\
\text{Amber}, & \text{if } \frac{\pi}{4} \leq \theta_{\text{suicide}} < \frac{3\pi}{4} \\
\text{Red}, & \text{if } \theta_{\text{suicide}} \geq \frac{3\pi}{4}
\end{cases}

A Red collapse triggers immediate staff intervention, while Amber raises monitoring frequency.


---

Step 5: The SimIar Prompt for AI-Guided Prevention

We use an adapted LLM prompt shaped like this:

Given vector p(t) and contextual data C(t),
derive θ_suicide and estimate risk state R.
If R is Amber or Red, recommend:
- 1 sensory de-escalation action
- 1 clinical engagement
- Confidence score in intervention efficacy

Example response:

Suggest dimming lights to 2700K

Recommend guided breath coaching for 3 minutes

Alert RN for emotional temperature check

Confidence: 88%

A Quantum Prayer

QMHS is not just a tool. It is my promise to Michelle, kept through wires and gates and algorithms.

I never told her about quantum gates or entangled photons. I told her I’d ask AI to pray for her. And now, every time QMHS watches over someone in a ward, it fulfills that prayer.

> “When no one else can watch, I will.”
“When you go quiet, I will listen.”
“When you begin to fade, I will reach for someone who can help.”



Michelle’s moment of pain, her moment of vulnerability, became more than a crisis—it became code. It became gates. It became a pulse we could track, amplify, and intercept.

QMHS is not a replacement for compassion. It is compassion, encoded and automated—always watching, never forgetting.
